Introduction:
The tweet ticker is a project based on JSON, HTML, CSS, Javascript. This project shows 5 tweets and hashtags at a time and will slowly cycle through the tweets every three seconds.

Installation:
Run on the local server, and install apache.

Brief idea of the project:
First, link JSON file with html by using AJAX function, then you get all the needed information on the page. After that I use the animate function to cycle the word list. And in the CSS file I only show five tweets in the page.
