Introduction:
Connect to the weather API of OpenWeatherMap using the current location by HTML5 Geolocation to get the weather report.

Installation:
Run on the local server, and install apache. 
Install bootstrap.

Brief idea of the project:
Get the current location from the browser by Geolocation and then pass the location parameters to the api and get the weather data present it in the html.
Decorate the page and feel like an app.
In order to make the project like an app, I copy the concept of iphone clock and add the dynamic clock using the flipclock.js.

File included:
Geo.js, index.html, style.css, style_bak.css, bg.jpg, widget_bg.png
